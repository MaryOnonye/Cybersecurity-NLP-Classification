      "['Cloud infrastructure security company Wiz on Thursday revealed details of a now-fixed Azure Cosmos database vulnerability that could have been potentially exploited to grant any Azure user full admin access to other customers\\' database instances without any authorization.\\nThe flaw, which grants read, write, and delete privileges, has been dubbed \"ChaosDB,\" with Wiz researchers noting that \"the vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn\\'t require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies.\"\\nCosmos DB is Microsoft\\'s proprietary NoSQL database that\\'s advertised as \"a fully managed service\" that \"takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates and patching.\"\\nThe Wiz Research Team reported the issue to Microsoft on August 12, after which the Windows maker took steps to mitigate the issue within 48 hours of responsible disclosure, in addition to awarding a $40,000 bounty to the finders on August 17.\\n\"We have no indication that external entities outside the researcher had access to the primary read-write key associated with your Azure Cosmos DB account(s),\" Microsoft said in a statement. \"In addition, we are not aware of any data access because of this vulnerability. Azure Cosmos DB accounts with a vNET or firewall enabled are protected by additional security mechanisms that prevent risk of unauthorized access.\"\\nThe exploit identified by Wiz concerns a chain of vulnerabilities in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB, enabling an adversary to obtain the credentials corresponding to the target Cosmos DB account, including the Primary Key, which provides access to the administrative resources for the database account.\\n\"Using these credentials, it is possible to view, modify, and delete data in the target Cosmos DB account via multiple channels,\" the researchers said. As a consequence, any Cosmos DB asset that has the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled is potentially impacted.\\nAlthough Microsoft notified over 30% of Cosmos DB customers about the potential security breach, Wiz expects the actual number to be much higher, given that the vulnerability has been exploitable for months.\\n\"Every Cosmos DB customer should assume they\\'ve been exposed,\" Wiz researchers noted, adding, \"we also recommend reviewing all past activity in your Cosmos DB account.\" Additionally, Microsoft is also urging its customers to regenerate their Cosmos DB Primary Keys to mitigate any risk arising from the flaw.\\n\\n', 'ShinyHunters, a notorious cybercriminal underground group that\\'s been on a data breach spree since last year, has been observed searching companies\\' GitHub repository source code for vulnerabilities that can be abused to stage larger scale attacks, an analysis of the hackers\\' modus operandi has revealed.\\n\"Primarily operating on Raid Forums, the collective\\'s moniker and motivation can partly be derived from their avatar on social media and other forums: a shiny Umbreon Pokémon,\" Intel 471 researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"As Pokémon players hunt and collect \"shiny\" characters in the game, ShinyHunters collects and resells user data.\"\\nThe revelation comes as the average cost of a data breach rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, making it the highest average cost in 17 years, with compromised credentials responsible for 20% of the breaches reported by over 500 organizations.\\nSince rising to prominence in April 2020, ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a string of data breaches, including Tokopedia, Wattpad, Pixlr, Bonobos, BigBasket, Mathway, Unacademy, MeetMindful, and Microsoft\\'s GitHub account, among others.\\nAn assessment by Risk Based Security found that the threat actor has exposed a total of more than 1.12 million unique email addresses belonging to S&P 100 organizations, education, government and military entities as of late 2020.\\nLast week, the group began selling a database purportedly containing the personal information of 70 million AT&T customers for a starting price of $200,000, although the U.S. telecom provider has denied suffering a breach of its systems.\\nShinyHunters has a checkered history of compromising websites and developer repositories to steal credentials or API keys to a company\\'s cloud services, which are subsequently abused to gain access to databases and gather sensitive information to be resold for profit or published for free on hacker forums.\\nThe adversary has also been observed targeting DevOps personnel or GitHub repositories in order to steal valid OAuth tokens, leveraging them to breach cloud infrastructure and bypass any two-factor authentication mechanisms.\\n\"ShinyHunters may not have as much notoriety as the ransomware groups that are currently causing havoc for enterprises all over the world. However, tracking actors like this are crucial to preventing your enterprise from being hit with such an attack,\" the researchers said.\\n\"The information ShinyHunters gathers is often turned around and sold on the same underground marketplaces where ransomware actors use it to launch their own attacks. If enterprises can move to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before they are ever launched.\"\\n\\n', 'Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India\\'s flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.\\nGroup-IB dubbed the campaign \"ColunmTK\" based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems.\\n\"The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant,\" the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company said.\\nWhile Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.\\n\"The airline confirmed vis-à-vis SITA on June 11, 2021 that the cyber attack on Air India [...] is not the same or in any way linked to the attack on SITA PSS,\" SITA told our publication over email.\\nAlso known by other monikers such as Winnti Umbrella, Axiom and Barium, APT41 is a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state advanced persistent threat known for its campaigns centered around information theft and espionage against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors to establish and maintain strategic access for stealing intellectual property and committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\\n\"Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware,\" according to FireEye. \"APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\"\\nOn May 21, Air India disclosed a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years in the wake of a supply chain attack directed at its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA earlier this February.\\nThe breach involved personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011, and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data, as well as credit card data.\\nFireEye\\'s Mandiant, which is assisting SITA with the incident response efforts, has since determined that the attack was highly sophisticated and that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and compromise indicators point to a single entity, adding the \"identity and motive of the perpetrator are not entirely conclusive.\"\\nLikely a New Attack Against Air India\\nGroup-IB\\'s analysis has now revealed that at least since Feb. 23, an infected device inside Air India\\'s network (named \"SITASERVER4\") communicated with a server hosting Cobalt Strike payloads dating all the way back to Dec. 11, 2020.\\nFollowing this initial compromise, the attackers are said to have established persistence and obtained passwords in order to pivot laterally to the broader network with the goal of gathering information inside the local network.\\nNo fewer than 20 devices were infected during the course of lateral movement, the company said. \"The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz,\" Group-IB Threat Intelligence Analyst, Nikita Rostovcev, said. \"The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware.\"\\nIn all, the adversary extracted 23.33 MB of data from five devices named SITASERVER4, AILCCUALHSV001, AILDELCCPOSCE01, AILDELCCPDB01, and WEBSERVER3, with the attackers taking 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline\\'s network. The initial entry point for the attack remains unknown as yet.\\nConnections to Barium are grounded on the basis of overlaps between the C2 servers found in the attack infrastructure with those used in earlier attacks and tactics employed by the threat actor to park their domains once their operations are over. Group-IB also said it discovered a file named \"Install.bat\" that bore similarities to payloads deployed in a 2020 global intrusion campaign.\\nWhen reached for a response, Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News that \"Despite the fact that the initial compromise vector remains unknown, Group-IB treats [the] SITA incident and Air India breach as interrelated.\"\\n\"This assumption is built on the fact that it was a server in Air India\\'s network that, Group-IB assumes, might have established [a] connection with SITA\\'s network that was breached first. According to Group-IB\\'s data, SITASERVER4 was the first host to have been infected within Air India\\'s network. This has also been confirmed by Air India,\" Volkov added.\\nHowever, it\\'s worth noting that SITASERVER4 was neither owned or managed by SITA. Speaking on background, SITA noted that the server in question had been previously used to host software offered by the company to Air India and that the specific software was removed from the server in 2019.\\nThe aviation IT provider also clarified that none of the methods that were used to target Air India since February 23 were put to use in the attacks on SITA PSS, adding the adversary was removed from its network weeks prior to the start of the malicious activity directed against the airline, implying that the two incidents had no bearing on one another.\\n\\n', 'Bolstering password policies in your organization is an important part of a robust cybersecurity strategy. Cybercriminals are using compromised accounts as one of their favorite tactics to infiltrate business-critical environments; as we\\'ve seen in recent news, these attacks can be dangerous and financially impactful.\\nUnfortunately, account compromise is a very successful attack method and requires much less effort than other attack vectors.\\nOne of the essential types of password protection recommended by noted cybersecurity standards is breached password detection. Hackers often use known breached password lists in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.\\nHere are some critical criteria to consider when your sysadmins are evaluating breached password protection solutions.\\nBreached password recommendations\\nIn the last few years, password security recommendations have evolved past the traditional recommendations regarding password security.\\nBusinesses have used Microsoft Active Directory for years to implement password policies in the organization. Standard Active Directory password policies include minimal password configuration settings.\\nBelow is an example of the settings offered with a conventional Active Directory Password Policy:\\nEnforce password history\\nMaximum password age\\nMinimum password age\\nMinimum password length\\nMinimum password length audit\\nPassword must meet complexity requirements\\nStore password using reversible encryption\\nBy default, Active Directory Password Policies do not include a solution to implement breached password protection.\\nActive Directory Password Policy settings\\nWhy is it important for businesses to start thinking about breached password protection? Let\\'s look at best practice recommendations from leading authorities in cybersecurity guidance.\\nNew password policy recommendations\\nAs mentioned, traditional password policies created using Active Directory are limited in features and capabilities. These allow creating basic password policies with standard length, complexity, age, and other requirements. However, there is no way to use native functionality to implement breached password protection.\\nWhile there is a means for implementing a password filter .dll in Active Directory to provision password dictionary protection, this is a manual process relying on the development of custom password filter .dll files.\\nNew password policy guidance from leading cybersecurity authorities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommend breached password protection. The NIST Special Publication 800-63B SP 800-63B Section 5.1.1.2 paragraph 9 states:\\n\"Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). However, verifiers SHALL force a change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.\"\\nBasically, NIST\\'s guidance recommends that organizations should force a password change if there is evidence of a breach. For businesses to have proof of a password breach, they must have a way to monitor the password landscape for breached passwords. In addition to monitoring for passwords to become breached, as users choose new passwords, the new password choices need to be checked.\\nEvaluating breached password detection services\\nBreached password detection is a recommended best practice for an additional layer of cyberattack prevention. Consider the following functions as must-haves to pay close attention to when choosing a solution:\\nEase of deployment\\nProactive monitoring\\nProactive password changes\\nBreached password database size\\nIntegration with current Active Directory password policies\\nEase of deployment\\nAn essential consideration businesses need to make when choosing a third-party breached password solution is deployment ease. Look for solutions that are easily deployed using existing Active Directory infrastructure. Solutions that are difficult to deploy will likely lead to configuration issues and challenges with implementation and time to value. Look for solutions that make use of existing Active Directory infrastructure along with Group Policy that allows quickly making use of existing policies and infrastructure.\\n1 — Proactive monitoring\\nOne of the essential requirements for breached password protection is proactive monitoring. Organizations need a solution that checks a password during the password set operation and proactively monitors the password landscape to find passwords that may become breached. This functionality helps to ensure passwords that may not be breached during creation, but become breached later, are correctly identified and can be remediated.\\n2 — Proactive password changes\\nDovetailing into the proactive monitoring of breached passwords in the environment, organizations need to look for a breached password protection solution that proactively requires end-users to change their password if these become breached. This feature helps ensure any passwords that become breached in the environment are remediated as quickly as possible.\\n3 — Breached password database size\\nKeep in mind that all breached password protection services are not equal in the number of breached passwords checked. Breached password databases may vary between different services. The more extensive the breached password database, the better for protecting against breached passwords. If the quantity of breached passwords isn\\'t transparently communicated, ask the vendor directly how many are included in their backend lists.\\n4 — Integration with current Active Directory password policies\\nSpecops Breached Password Protection\\nLook for a breached password protection solution that can integrate with current Active Directory password policies. It means you can leave GPO assignments in place that assign various password policies to specific users and will help to prevent \"reinventing the wheel.\"\\nSpecops Breached Password Protection\\nThe Specops Password Policy solution allows organizations to have powerful breached password protection as part of the environment\\'s password security. Features include all the top requirements, like:\\nProactive breached password monitoring and password change enforcement\\nEasily to deploy and integrates with existing Active Directory GPO-based password policies\\nDownloadable breached password database or API-based protection\\nManaged database of over 2-billion passwords and growing\\nWith the API-based approach, you get real-time breached password protection for your organization\\'s passwords\\nUsing Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection, you can easily rollout breached password protection using GPO-based Active Directory Password Policies that are already in place.\\nTo delve into the Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection, start a free trial anytime.\\n\\n', 'Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.\\nOne approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.\\nWhat\\'s the best way to protect your data?\\nIt seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.\\nThe following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.\\nAn employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home, and blocked the necessary data. For doing this, he received a reward of a mere $100.\\nIn order to prevent this incident from happening, it was enough for the manager to observe the employee accessing the database and performing unauthorized operations. A DAM solution would be helpful. Here you can browse more information about the DAM system tactics.\\nAs an example of how the DCAP system detected fraud, here is a customer\\'s case from SearchInform:\\nSearchInform FileAuditor identified several computers on which price lists were stored and where, in addition to selling prices, purchase prices were also listed. This information is confidential; it is prohibited to distribute it uncontrollably within or outside the company. If customers know the purchase prices, they will be armed with arguments and can negotiate the best discounts. There is clearly a loss for the seller.\\nThe price column was typed in white, which made the price list appear like it was normal. In spite of this, FileAuditor acknowledged that the purchase price was definitely included in the document. Investigating the case using the DLP system, the cybersecurity specialist discovered that employees had forwarded these price lists to external email addresses. A subsequent investigation confirmed that there was collusion between the buyers and sellers.\\nThis was classic scheming: the seller\\'s manager agreed to a large discount for the buyer on any pretext he could think of. The buyer representative agreed to repay a portion of the difference to the seller\\'s manager, who negotiated the discount.\\nSo, both the seller and manager benefited, while the company selling lost money. In the event of a violation, it can take up to a year for the damage to be identified; depending on the size of the business, this damage can range from thousands up to millions of dollars.\\nIt turns out that control of information sources enables an information security expert to detect an incident at its earliest stage - intention, rather than following up after it occurs. Tight control on such matters prohibits a more detailed investigation, which would allow evidence to be collected and conclusions drawn so that the incident wouldn\\'t repeat itself. Here, the information security specialist has tightened DLP security policies on documents that include purchase prices.\\nWhich is the best approach to data protection?\\nA complex approach. It\\'s not possible to solve everything with DLP. Not everything is really dependent on control of the source. However, when combined, these approaches give a super-effect. When the DCAP system detects a potential violation, the DLP system gathers evidence and allows conclusions to be drawn on how to improve business processes and make them more transparent.\\nWhat are DCAP and DAM?\\nDCAP and DAM solutions are already on the market in mass quantities due to the need for data at rest protection. In addition, this software is easy to use and integrates with already popular security solutions.\\nYou can use SearchInform FileAuditor to determine:\\nwhich documents contain business-critical information,\\nhow much of this information is stored by the company and where it is located,\\nwho has access to them and can modify them.\\nIt is possible for the IT department to take on such tasks. For instance, DCAP makes the file system less messy since each document is assigned a category (contracts, prices, personal data, research, etc.).\\n\\n\\nProbably not the most important feature, but shadow copying is a useful feature, which lets you restore documents without any problems if something goes wrong. As a first step, however, the software is intended for information security specialists.\\nHere\\'s how FileAuditor works:\\nsearches for a file\\nassesses its compliance with the rules and labels it (\"personal data,\" \"agreement,\" etc.)\\nif necessary, copy a file to the repository.\\nkeeps track of all actions with files and folders\\nreads permissions on files and folders\\nat subsequent checks, only newly added or changed files are scanned.\\nThis year, SearchInform also released its own database monitoring solution - SearchInform Database Monitor. A database is the main information asset of businesses, so it plays a critical role in their operations. Fraudsters are interested in both the entire array and specific access points to data.

Only customers who performed In-Place Upgrades between April 20, 8:33 PM UTC, and April 22, 0:30 AM UTC are said to be affected.\\nWhile Passwordstate serves about 29,000 customers, the Adelaide-based firm maintained that the total number of impacted customers is very low. It\\'s also urging users to refrain from posting correspondence from the company on social media, stating the actor behind the breach is actively monitoring such platforms for information pertaining to the attack in order to exploit it to their advantage for carrying out related intrusions.\\nThe original attack was carried out via a trojanized Passwordstate update file containing a modified DLL (\"moserware.secretsplitter.dll\") that, in turn, extracted retrieved a second-stage payload from a remote server so as to extract sensitive information from compromised systems. As a countermeasure, Click Studios released a hotfix package named \"Moserware.zip\\'\\' to help customers remove the tampered DLL and advised affected users to reset all passwords stored in the password manager.\\nThe newly spotted phishing attack involves crafting seemingly legitimate email messages that \"replicate Click Studios email content\" — based on the emails that were shared by customers on social media — to push a new variant of the malware.\\n\"The phishing attack is requesting customers to download a modified hotfix Moserware.zip file, from a CDN Network not controlled by Click Studios, that now appears to have been taken down,\" the company said. \"Initial analysis indicates this has a newly modified version of the malformed Moserware.SecretSplitter.dll, that on loading then attempts to use an alternate site to obtain the payload file.\"\\nThe Passwordstate hack is the latest high-profile supply-chain attack to come to light in recent months, highlighting how sophisticated threat groups are targeting software built by third parties as a stepping-stone to break into sensitive government and corporate computer networks.\\n\\n', 'A staggering number of 3.28 billion passwords linked to 2.18 billion unique email addresses were exposed in what\\'s one of the largest data dumps of breached usernames and passwords.\\nIn addition, the leak includes 1,502,909 passwords associated with email addresses from government domains across the world, with the U.S. government alone taking up 625,505 of the exposed passwords, followed by the U.K (205,099), Australia (136,025), Brazil (68,535), and Canada (50,726).\\nThe findings come from an analysis of a massive 100GB data set called \"COMB21\" — aka Compilation of Many Breaches — that was published for free in an online cybercrime forum earlier this February by putting together data from multiple leaks in different companies and organizations that occurred over the years.\\nIt\\'s worth noting that a leak doesn\\'t imply a breach of public administration systems. The passwords are said to have been obtained via techniques such as password hash cracking after being stolen or through phishing attacks and eavesdropping on insecure, plaintext connections.\\nThe top 10 U.S. government domains affected by the leak are as follows:\\nState Department - state.gov (29,144)\\nVeterans Affairs Department - va.gov (28,937)\\nDepartment of Homeland Security - dhs.gov (21,575)\\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration - nasa.gov (15,665)\\nInternal Revenue Service - irs.gov (10,480)\\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention - cdc.gov (8,904)\\nDepartment of Justice - usdoj.gov (8,857)\\nSocial Security Administration - ssa.gov (8,747)\\nU.S. Postal Service - usps.gov (8,205), and\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency - epa.gov (7,986)\\nInterestingly, this leak also includes 13 credentials linked to emails of the Oldsmar water plant in Florida, as previously reported by CyberNews. However, there\\'s no evidence that the breached passwords were used to carry out the cyberattack in February. In contrast, only 18,282 passwords related to Chinese government domains and 1,964 passwords from those related to Russia were laid bare.\\n\"It is an indication that the passwords in these countries, made up of local alphabets, are less targeted by hackers. It is an unexpected layer of protection in relation to the Roman alphabet,\" said Syhunt Founder and Chief Visionary Officer (CVO) Felipe Daragon.\\nOn a related note, a notorious threat actor named ShinyHunters has posted an alleged database consisting of 20 million BigBasket users for free, almost five months after the Indian online grocery delivery startup confirmed a data breach. According to Under the Breach\\'s Alon Gal, the database includes users\\' email addresses, phone numbers, residential addresses, hashed passwords, dates of birth, and order histories.\\nIn the past, ShinyHunters has been connected to the sale of personal data from several companies, including Zoosk, SocialShare, Tokopedia, TeeSpring, Mindful, Minted, Chatbooks, Dave, Promo, Mathway, Wattpad, MeetMindful.com, and StarTribune.\\nUsers who have had their information exposed are strongly advised to change their existing passwords.\\n\\n', 'Online trading and discount brokerage platform Upstox has become the latest Indian company to suffer a security breach of its systems, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information of approximately 2.5 million users on the dark web.\\nThe leaked information includes names, email addresses, dates of birth, bank account information, and about 56 million know your customer (KYC) documents pulled from the company\\'s server.\\nThe breach was first disclosed by independent researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia on April 11. It\\'s not immediately clear when the incident occurred.\\nReacting to the development, the company however said it had recently upgraded its security systems following reports of \"unauthorized access into our database\" while stressing that users\\' funds and securities remained protected.\\nAs a precaution, besides initiating a secure password reset of users\\' accounts, Upstox said it restricted access to the impacted database, implying it was a case of a misconfigured AWS server. In addition, the company said it\\'s incorporating multiple security enhancements at its third-party data warehouses and ring-fencing the network. Upstox refrained from specifying the exact number of client accounts that may have been exposed.\\nNews of Upstox\\'s security breach comes weeks after an India-based digital wallet service MobiKwik dealt with a major security incident after 8.2 terabytes (TB) of data belonging to millions of its users began circulating on cybercrime forums.\\nOther Indian companies such as BigBasket, Dunzo, Edureka, Paytm Mall, and Byju\\'s-owned WhiteHat Jr too have reported data breaches in recent months.\\n\\n', 'The maintainers of the PHP programming language have issued an update regarding the security incident that came to light late last month, stating that the actors may have gotten hold of a user database containing their passwords to make unauthorized changes to the repository.\\n\"We no longer believe the git.php.net server has been compromised. However, it is possible that the master.php.net user database leaked,\" Nikita Popov said in a message posted on its mailing list on April 6.\\nOn March 28, unidentified actors used the names of Rasmus Lerdorf and Popov to push malicious commits to the \"php-src\" repository hosted on the git.php.net server that involved adding a backdoor to the PHP source code in an instance of a software supply chain attack.\\nWhile this was initially treated as a compromise of the git.php.net server, further investigation into the incident has revealed that the commits were a result of pushing them using HTTPS and password-based authentication, leading them to suspect a possible leak of the master.php.net user database.\\nThe \"git.php.net (intentionally) support[s] pushing changes not only via SSH (using the Gitolite infrastructure and public key cryptography), but also via HTTPS,\" Popov said. \"The latter did not use Gitolite, and instead used git-http-backend behind Apache 2 Digest authentication against the master.php.net user database.\"\\n\"It is notable that the attacker only makes a few guesses at usernames, and successfully authenticates once the correct username has been found. While we don\\'t have any specific evidence for this, a possible explanation is that the user database of master.php.net has been leaked, although it is unclear why the attacker would need to guess usernames in that case.\"\\nAdditionally, the master.php.net authentication system is said to be on a very old operating system and a version of PHP, raising the possibility that the attackers may have also exploited a vulnerability in the software to stage the attack.\\nAs a consequence, the maintainers have migrated master.php.net to a new main.php.net system with support for TLS 1.2, in addition to resetting all existing passwords and storing passwords using bcrypt instead of a plain MD5 hash.\\n\\n', 'In what\\'s likely to be a goldmine for bad actors, personal information associated with approximately 533 million Facebook users worldwide has been leaked on a popular cybercrime forum for free—which was harvested by hackers in 2019 using a Facebook vulnerability.\\nThe leaked data includes full names, Facebook IDs, mobile numbers, locations, email addresses, gender, occupation, city, country, marital status broken, account creation date, and other profile details broken down by country, with over 32 million records belonging to users in the U.S., 11 million users the U.K., and six million users in India, among others.\\nAlso included in the leak are phone numbers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and co-founders Chris Hughes, and Dustin Moskovitz, who are the fourth, fifth, and sixth members to have registered on Facebook.\\nInterestingly, it appears that the same phone number is also registered to his name on the privacy-focussed messaging app Signal. \"Mark Zuckerberg also respects his own privacy, by using a chat app that has end-to-end encryption and isn\\'t owned by @facebook,\" tweeted Synack Red Team researcher Dave Walker.\\nIn total, the data being offered includes user information from 106 countries. Additionally, the data seems to have been obtained by exploiting a vulnerability that enabled automated scripts to scrape Facebook users\\' public profiles and associated private phone numbers en masse. The flaw has since been fixed by Facebook.\\n\"This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019,\" said Liz Bourgeois, Facebook\\'s director of strategic response communications, in a Saturday tweet.\\nOld data or not, the fact that the data appears to have been obtained by scraping Facebook profiles further complicates the company\\'s equation with privacy, even as it has emerged relatively unscathed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, in which the British consulting firm amassed of the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for purposes of political advertising.\\nWhile this data dump appears to have sold in cybercrime communities at least since last year, a Telegram bot that appeared on the scene earlier this January allowed users to look up a phone number and receive the corresponding user\\'s Facebook ID, or vice versa for a fee.\\nBut with the data now available publicly for free, it\\'s likely that the leak will allow malicious adversaries to exploit information for social engineering, marketing scams, and other cybercrimes. Users who have shared their phone numbers and email addresses with Facebook and have not changed them since 2019 are advised to watch out for possible smishing attacks, spam calls, and fraud.\\n\\n', 'A newly discovered glitch in Zoom\\'s screen sharing feature can accidentally leak sensitive information to other attendees in a call, according to the latest findings.\\nTracked as CVE-2021-28133, the unpatched security vulnerability makes it possible to reveal contents of applications that are not shared, but only briefly, thereby making it harder to exploit it in the wild.\\nIt\\'s worth pointing out that the screen sharing functionality in Zoom lets users share an entire desktop or phone screen, or limit sharing to one or more specific applications, or a portion of a screen. The issue stems from the fact that a second application that\\'s overlayed on top of an already shared application can reveal its contents for a short period of time.\\n\"When a Zoom user shares a specific application window via the \\'share screen\\' functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows which were not explicitly shared,\" SySS researchers Michael Strametz and Matthias Deeg noted. \"The contents of not shared application windows can, for instance, be seen for a short period of time by other users when those windows overlay the shared application window and get into focus.\"\\nThe flaw, which was tested on versions 5.4.3 and 5.5.4 across both Windows and Linux clients, is said to have been disclosed to the videoconferencing company on December 2, 2020. The lack of a fix even after three months could be attributed in part to the difficulty in exploiting the vulnerability.\\nBut nonetheless, this could have serious consequences depending on the nature of the inadvertently shared data, the researchers warned, adding a malicious participant of a Zoom meeting can take advantage of the weakness by making use of a screen capture tool to record the meeting and playback the recording to view the private information.\\nWhen reached for a response, a Zoom spokesperson said it\\'s working to address the issue. \"Zoom takes all reports of security vulnerabilities seriously,\" the company told The Hacker News via email. \"We are aware of this issue, and are working to resolve it.\"\\n\\n', 'The Office of the Washington State Auditor (SAO) on Monday said it\\'s investigating a security incident that resulted in the compromise of personal information of more than 1.6 million people who filed for unemployment claims in the state in 2020.\\nThe SAO blamed the breach on a software vulnerability in Accellion\\'s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) service, which allows organizations to share sensitive documents with users outside their organization securely.\\n\"During the week of January 25, 2021, Accellion confirmed that an unauthorized person gained access to SAO files by exploiting a vulnerability in Accellion\\'s file transfer service,\" the SAO said in a statement.\\nThe accessed information is said to have contained personal details of Washington state residents who filed unemployment insurance claims in 2020, as well as other data from local governments and state agencies.\\nThe exact information that may have been compromised include:\\nFull name\\nSocial security number\\nDriver\\'s license\\nState identification number\\nBank account number and bank routing number, and\\nPlace of employment\\nThe unauthorized access incident is believed to have occurred in late December of last year, although it appears the full scope of the intrusion wasn\\'t made aware until Accellion disclosed earlier this month that its file transfer application was the \"target of a sophisticated cyberattack.\"\\nThe Palo Alto-based cloud solutions company said on January 11 that it was made aware of a vulnerability in its legacy FTA software in mid-December, following which it claimed it addressed the issue and released a patch \"within 72 hours\" to the less than 50 customers affected.\\nAccellion also said it\\'s contracting with an \"industry-leading cybersecurity forensics firm\" to investigate the incident.\\nGiven that the compromised information can be abused to carry out identity theft or fraud, the SAO said it\\'s in the process of arranging measures to protect the identities of those whose information may have been contained within SAO\\'s files.\\nIn the meanwhile, the agency recommends reviewing account statements and credit reports, notifying financial institutions of any suspicious activity, and reporting any suspected incidents of identity theft to law enforcement.\\nIt\\'s worth noting that Accellion\\'s FTA software was used as an attack vector to strike two other organizations, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), in recent weeks.\\n', '21 people have been arrested across the UK as part of a nationwide cyber crackdown targeting customers of WeLeakInfo[.]com, a now-defunct online service that had been previously selling access to data hacked from other websites.\\nThe suspects used stolen personal credentials to commit further cyber and fraud offences, the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\\nOf the 21 arrested — all men aged between 18 and 38 — nine have been detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, nine for Fraud offences, and three are under investigation for both. The NCA also seized over £41,000 in bitcoin from the arrested individuals.\\nEarlier this January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the NCA, the Netherlands National Police Corps, the German Bundeskriminalamt, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland jointly seized the domain of WeLeakInfo.com.\\nLaunched in 2017, the service provided its users a search engine to access the personal information illegally obtained from over 10,000 data breaches and containing over 12 billion indexed stolen credentials, including, for example, names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and passwords for online accounts.\\nOn top of that, WeLeakInfo offered subscription plans, allowing unlimited searches and access to the results of these data breaches during the subscription period that lasted anywhere from one day ($2), one week ($7), one month ($25), or three months ($70).\\nThe cheap subscriptions made the website accessible to even entry-level, apprentice-type hackers, letting them get hold of a huge cache of data for as little as $2 a day, and in turn, use those stolen passwords to mount credential stuffing attacks.\\nFollowing the domain\\'s seizure in January, two 22-year-old men, one in the Netherlands and another in Northern Ireland, were arrested in connection with running the site. WeLeakInfo\\'s Twitter handle has since gone quiet.\\nThe NCA said besides being customers of the website, some of the arrested men had also purchased other cybercrime tools such as remote access Trojans (RATs) and crypters, with three other subjects found to be in possession of indecent images of children.\\n\"Cyber criminals rely on the fact that people duplicate passwords on multiple sites and data breaches create the opportunity for fraudsters to exploit that,\" NCA\\'s Paul Creffield said. \"Password hygiene is therefore extremely important.\"\\n\\n', 'The massive state-sponsored espionage campaign that compromised software maker SolarWinds also targeted Microsoft, as the unfolding investigation into the hacking spree reveals the incident may have been far more wider in scope, sophistication, and impact than previously thought.\\nNews of Microsoft\\'s compromise was first reported by Reuters, which also said the company\\'s own products were then used to strike other victims by leveraging its cloud offerings, citing people familiar with the matter.\\nThe Windows maker, however, denied the threat actor had infiltrated its production systems to stage further attacks against its customers.\\nIn a statement to The Hacker News via email, the company said —\\n\"Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed.

A few others are modified versions of publicly available tools designed to evade basic security detection mechanisms, while the rest are proprietary attack utilities developed in-house.\\nTo minimize the potential impact of the theft of these tools, the company has also released 300 countermeasures, including a list of 16 previously disclosed critical flaws that should be addressed to limit the effectiveness of the Red Team tools.\\nIf anything, the development is yet another indication that no companies, counting cybersecurity firms, are immune to targeted attacks.\\nMajor cybersecurity firms such as Kaspersky Lab, RSA Security, Avast, and Bit9 have previously fallen victims to damaging hacks over the past decade.\\nThe incident also bears faint similarities to The Shadow Brokers\\' leak of offensive hacking tools used by the US National Security Agency in 2016, which also included the EternalBlue zero-day exploit that was later weaponized to distribute the WannaCry ransomware.\\n\"Security companies are a prime target for nation-state operators for many reasons, but not least of all is [the] ability to gain valuable insights about how to bypass security controls within their ultimate targets,\" Crowdstrike\\'s co-founder and former CTO Dmitri Alperovitch said.\\nThe release of red team tools stolen by the adversary \"will go a long way to mitigating the potential impact of this intrusion for organizations all over the world,\" he added.\\n\\n', 'A hacking group known for its attacks in the Middle East, at least since 2017, has recently been found impersonating legitimate messaging apps such as Telegram and Threema to infect Android devices with a new, previously undocumented malware.\\n\"Compared to the versions documented in 2017, Android/SpyC23.A has extended spying functionality, including reading notifications from messaging apps, call recording and screen recording, and new stealth features, such as dismissing notifications from built-in Android security apps,\" cybersecurity firm ESET said in a Wednesday analysis.\\nFirst detailed by Qihoo 360 in 2017 under the moniker Two-tailed Scorpion (aka APT-C-23 or Desert Scorpion), the mobile malware has been deemed \"surveillanceware\" for its abilities to spy on the devices of targeted individuals, exfiltrating call logs, contacts, location, messages, photos, and other sensitive documents in the process.\\nIn 2018, Symantec discovered a newer variant of the campaign that employed a malicious media player as a lure to grab information from the device and trick victims into installing additional malware.\\nThen earlier this year, Check Point Research detailed fresh signs of APT-C-23 activity when Hamas operators posed as young teenage girls on Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram to lure Israeli soldiers into installing malware-infected apps on their phones.\\nThe latest version of the spyware detailed by ESET expands on these features, including the ability to collect information from social media and messaging apps via screen recording and screenshots, and even capture incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read the text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook, Skype, and Messenger.\\nThe infection begins when a victim visits a fake Android app store called \"DigitalApps,\" and downloads apps such as Telegram, Threema, and weMessage, suggesting that the group\\'s motivation behind impersonating messaging apps is to \"justify the various permissions requested by the malware.\"\\nIn addition to requesting invasive permissions to read notifications, turn off Google Play Protect, and record a user\\'s screen under the guise of security and privacy features, the malware communicates with its command-and-control (C2) server to register the newly infected victim and transmit the device information.\\nThe C2 servers, which typically masquerade as websites under maintenance, are also responsible for relaying the commands to the compromised phone, which can be used to record audio, restart Wi-Fi, uninstall any app installed on the device, among others.\\nWhat\\'s more, it also comes equipped with a new feature that allows it to stealthily make a call while creating a black screen overlay to mask the call activity.\\n\"Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations. Android/SpyC32.A – the group\\'s newest spyware version — features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims,\" ESET said.\\nApps downloaded from fraudulent third-party app stores has been a conduit for Android malware in recent years. It\\'s always essential to stick to official sources to limit risk, and scrutinize permissions requested by apps before installing them on the device.\\n\\n', 'A Russian hacker who was found guilty of hacking LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Formspring over eight years ago has finally been sentenced to 88 months in United States prison, that\\'s more than seven years by a federal court in San Francisco this week.\\nYevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, 32, of Moscow hacked into servers belonging to three American social media firms, including LinkedIn, Dropbox, and now-defunct social-networking firm Formspring, and stole data on over 200 million users.\\nBetween March and July 2012, Nikulin hacked into the computers of LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Formspring, and installed malware on them, which allowed him to remotely download user databases of over 117 Million LinkedIn users and more than 68 Million Dropbox users.\\nAccording to the prosecutor, Nikulin also worked with unnamed co-conspirators of a Russian-speaking cybercriminal forum to sell customer data he stole as a result of his hacks.\\nBesides hacking into the three social media firms, Nikulin has also been accused of gaining access to LinkedIn and Formspring employees\\' credentials, which helped him carry out the computer hacks.\\n\"The Court also found that Automattic, parent company of Wordpress.com, was the victim of an intrusion by defendant, although there was no evidence that defendant stole any customer credentials,\" the Justice Department said.\\nNikulin was arrested in Prague on October 5, 2016, by Interpol agents working in collaboration with the FBI, and extradited to the United States in March 2018 after a long extradition battle between the U.S. and Russia.\\nIn 2016, the hacker was charged with nine felony counts of computer intrusion, aggravated identity theft, causing damage to a protected computer, trafficking in unauthorized access devices, and conspiracy.\\nHowever, after a long delay of trials due to the coronavirus pandemic, Nikulin was found guilty by a federal jury of the United States in early July this year and was sentenced to 88 months in prison on September 29.\\nU.S. District Judge William H. Alsup convicted Nikulin of selling stolen usernames and passwords, installing malware on protected computers, conspiracy, computer intrusion, and aggravated identity theft.\\nPrior to the sentencing hearing on September 29, federal prosecutors sought a sentence of 145 months in prison, that\\'s over 12 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution.\\nNikulin has been in U.S. custody since his extradition from the Czech Republic and will be serving his sentence effect immediately.\\n\\n', 'The South African arm of one of the world\\'s largest credit check companies Experian yesterday announced a data breach incident that exposed personal information of millions of its customers.\\n\\nWhile Experian itself didn\\'t mention the number of affect customers, in a report, the South African Banking Risk Information Centre—an anti-fraud and banking non-profit organization who worked with Experian to investigate the breach—disclosed that the attacker had reportedly stolen data of 24 million South Africans and 793,749 business entities.\\n\\nNotably, according to the company, the suspected attacker behind this breach had already been identified, and the stolen data of its customers had successfully been deleted from his/her computing devices.\\n\\n\"We have identified the suspect and confirm that Experian South Africa was successful in obtaining and executing an Anton Piller order which resulted in the individual\\'s hardware being impounded and the misappropriated data being secured and deleted.\"\\n\\nExperian South Africa has already reported the breach to law enforcement and the appropriate regulatory authorities.\\n\\nThe company claims there is no evidence indicating whether the stolen data includes consumers\\' credit or financial information or used for fraudulent purposes before authorities had it deleted.\\n\\n\"Our investigations also show that the suspect had intended to use the data to create marketing leads to offer insurance and credit-related services.\"\\n\\n\"The compromise of personal information can create opportunities for criminals to impersonate you but does not guarantee access to your banking profile or accounts. However, criminals can use this information to trick you into disclosing your confidential banking details,\" says SABRIC CEO, Nischal Mewalall.\\n\\n\\nBesides releasing this information, SAFPS also recommended that credit reporting agency customers should immediately apply for a free Protective Registration listing with Southern Africa Fraud Prevention Service that has been designed to alert users when their identity is compromised.\\n\\nYou can also regularly check your credit report for free here.\\n', 'Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed several security issues in popular online dating platform OkCupid that could potentially let attackers remotely spy on users\\' private information or perform malicious actions on behalf of the targeted accounts.\\n\\nAccording to a report shared with The Hacker News, researchers from Check Point found that the flaws in OkCupid\\'s Android and web applications could allow the theft of users\\' authentication tokens, users IDs, and other sensitive information such as email addresses, preferences, sexual orientation, and other private data.\\n\\nAfter Check Point researchers responsibly shared their findings with OkCupid, the Match Group-owned company fixed the issues, stating, \"not a single user was impacted by the potential vulnerability.\"\\n\\nThe Chain of Flaws\\n\\nThe flaws were identified as part of reverse engineering of OkCupid\\'s Android app version 40.3.1, which was released on April 29 earlier this year. Since then, there have been 15 updates to the app with the most recent version (43.3.2) hitting Google Play Store yesterday.\\n\\nCheck Point said OkCupid\\'s use of deep links could enable a bad actor to send a custom link defined in the app\\'s manifest file to open a browser window with JavaScript enabled. Any such request was found to return the users\\' cookies.\\n\\n\\nThe researchers also uncovered a separate flaw in OkCupid\\'s settings functionality that makes it vulnerable to an XSS attack by injecting malicious JavaScript code using the \"section\" parameter as follows: \"https://www.okcupid.com/settings?section=value\"\\n\\nThe aforementioned XSS attack can be augmented further by loading a JavaScript payload from an attacker-controlled server to steal authentication tokens, profile information, and user preferences, and transmit the amassed data back to the server.\\n\\n\"Users\\' cookies are sent to the [OkCupid] server since the XSS payload is executed in the context of the application\\'s WebView,\" the researchers said, outlining their method to capture the token information. \"The server responds with a vast JSON containing the users\\' id and the authentication token.\"\\n\\nOnce in possession of the user ID and the token, an adversary can send a request to the \"https://www.OkCupid.com:443/graphql\" endpoint to fetch all the information associated with the victim\\'s profile (email address, sexual orientation, height, family status, and other personal preferences) as well as carry out actions on behalf of the compromised individual, such as send messages and change profile data.\\n\\n\\nHowever, a full account hijack is not possible as the cookies are protected with HTTPOnly, mitigating the risk of a client-side script accessing the protected cookie.\\n\\nLastly, an oversight in the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy of the API server could have permitted an attacker to craft requests from any origin (e.g. \"https://okcupidmeethehacker.com\") in order to get hold of the user ID and authentication token, and subsequently, use that information to extract profile details and messages using the API\\'s \"profile\" and \"messages\" endpoints.\\n\\nRemember Ashley Madison Breach and Blackmail Threats?\\n\\nAlthough the vulnerabilities were not exploited in the wild, the episode is yet another reminder of how bad actors could have taken advantage of the flaws to threaten victims with black and extortion.\\n\\n\\nAfter Ashley Madison, an adult dating service catering to married individuals seeking partners for affairs was hacked in 2015 and information about its 32 million users was posted to the dark web, it led to a rise in phishing and sextortion campaigns, with blackmailers reportedly sending personalized emails to the users, threatening to reveal their membership to friends and family unless they pay money.\\n\\n\"The dire need for privacy and data security becomes far more crucial when so much private and intimate information is being stored, managed and analyzed in an app,\" the researchers concluded. \"The app and platform was created to bring people together, but of course where people go, criminals will follow, looking for easy pickings.\"\\n\\n']\n"
